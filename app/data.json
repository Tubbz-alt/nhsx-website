Responding to the Covid-19 crisis will require everything we have and more. In the fight against this pandemic, decision-makers will need accurate real-timeinformation. To understand and anticipate demand on health and care services, we need a robust operating picture of the virus, how it\\u2019s spreading, where it might spread next and how that will affect the NHS and social care services. On the supply side, we need to know where the system is likely to face strain first, be that on ventilators, beds or staff sickness.</p><p>Different parts of the NHS already capture much of this information, but staying ahead of this virus and flattening the curve will require us to streamline the way we use that information. In a crisis response, inconsistencies in this data could cost lives. The last few weeks have seen increased stress on the system with multiple additional requests for information, and a complex and wide array of information sources that must be considered. Without a single place to gather and analyse this data, decision-makers are unable to move as quickly as the response demands; information in spreadsheets held by disparate organisations will be duplicated and rapidly become outdated, leading to inaccurate or incomplete understanding of the situation.\\u00a0</p><h3>So what are we doing?</h3><p>To execute a coordinated and effective Covid-19 response, the Government has commissioned NHS England and Improvement and NHSX to develop a data platform that will provide those national organisations responsible for coordinating the response with secure, reliable and timely data - in a way that protects theprivacy of our citizens - in order to make informed, effective decisions.\\u00a0</p><p>NHS England and Improvement will create a data store to bring multiple data sources into a single, secure location. This is what we are calling the backend or initial store. Data needed to inform the Covid-19response will come from across the NHS and social care and from partner organisations. It will include data such as 111 online/call centre data from NHS Digital and Covid-19 test result data from Public Health England.\\u00a0</p><p>To provide a single source of truth about the rapidly evolving situation, data will then be integrated, cleaned, and harmonised in order to develop the single and reliable information\\u00a0that is needed to support decision-making. The results will be presented as dashboards that give\\u00a0a live view of the metrics needed to track and understand the current spread of the crisis, and the capacity in the healthcare system to deal with it.\\u00a0</p><p>All NHS data in the store will remain under NHS England and NHS Improvement\\u2019s control. Once the public health emergency situation has ended, data will either be destroyed or returned in line with the law and the strict contractual agreements that are in place between the NHS and partners.</p><p>A beta form of our first dashboard will be ready to share with key government decision-makers this week, with\\u00a0the intention to make as much data openly available as possible over time, including a separate dashboard to support public understanding. We will make the code and the data open source wherever we can while ensuring the highest standards of confidentiality.</p><h3>What this will allow us to do</h3><p>By consolidating information from across the NHS and partner organisations, we will give decision-makers more accurate visibility into the status of the response. This includes metrics such as:</p><ul><li>Current occupancy levels at hospitals, broken down by general beds and specialist and/or critical care beds</li><li>Current capacity of A&amp;E departments and current waiting times</li><li>Statistics about the lengths of stay for Covid-19 patients</li></ul><p>These metrics will be able to be analysed from the national level down to individual NHS Trusts and hospitals. With an accurate view of these metrics in place, the data allows decision-makers to answer questions about the response and explore the impact of different decisions. This will lead to a better\\u00a0understanding of how the virus is spreading, when and where the healthcare system will face strain, and which interventions can best mitigate the crisis.\\u00a0</p><p>Using the dashboards, decision-makers will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand how the virus is spreading at a local level and identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations;</li><li>Proactively increase health and care resources in emerging hot spots;</li><li>Ensure critical equipment is supplied to the facilities with greatest need; and</li><li>Divert patients/service users\\u00a0to the facilities that are best able to care for them based on demand, resources, and staffing capacity.</li></ul><h3>How is confidentiality being protected?\\u00a0</h3><p>While moving at speed, essential data governance procedures and established principles of openness and transparency remain at the core of everything we do. We are following the same rules forinformation governance that underpin our day-to-day work.\\u00a0</p><p>The data brought into the back end datastore held by NHS England and NHS Improvement will largely be from existing data sources e.g. data already collected by NHS England and NHS Improvement, Public Health England and NHS Digital. All NHS data remains under NHS England and NHS Improvement control.</p><p>All the data held in the platform is subject to strict controls that meet the requirements of data protection legislation. GDPR principles will be followed, for example the data will only be used for Covid-19 and not for any other purpose and only relevant information will be collected. Any request to access data will be reviewed through a single process controlled solely by NHS England and NHS Improvement and NHSX.</p><h3>Who is working on it</h3><p>In this time of crisis, we need the private sector to play its part to tackle these unprecedented challenges. We have therefore enlisted the help of some of the most cutting edge and experienced firms from across Britain\\u2019s technology sector.\\u00a0It is of paramount importance that the back end data store and front end platform are secure, and that all NHS data remains under NHS England and NHS Improvement\\u2019s control.\\u00a0Our technology partners are subject to the same strict rules for information governance that we follow in our day to day work.\\u00a0</p><ul><li>NHSX\\u00a0along with\\u00a0NHS England and Improvement\\u00a0are leading on this project working with multiple partners leveraging internal skills and also skills from the wider NHS family. The team is being ledby the Director of AI, Indra Joshi, and Ming Tang, Director of Data/Analytics, NHS England/Improvement</li><li>Microsoft\\u00a0is supporting NHSX and NHS England\\u2019s technical teams, who have built a backend data store on Microsoft\\u2019s cloud platform, Azure, to bring multiple data sources into a single, secure location. A G-cloud data processing contract is in place.</li><li>Palantir Technologies UK\\u00a0is providing the software,Palantir Foundry, that powers the front end data platform. Palantir Foundry, which has been primarily developed in the UK, enables disparate data to be integrated, cleaned, and harmonised in order to develop the single source of truth that will support decision-making. Foundry is built to protect data by design. A G-cloud data processing contract is in place. Palantir is a data processor, not a data controller, and cannot pass on or use the data for any wider purpose without the permission of NHS England</li><li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\u00a0is helping to provide infrastructure and technologies that are enabling NHSX and its partners to quickly and securely launch the new Covid-19 response platform for critical public services at a time when it is important for public and private sector organisations to work together to combat this crisis.\\u00a0AWS has the highest score awarded by the NHS Data Security &amp; Protection (DSP) Toolkit.</li><li>Faculty\\u00a0is a London-based AI technology specialist that has an existing partnership with NHSX and is now supporting the development and execution of the data response strategy. This includes developing dashboards, models and simulations to provide key central government decision-makers with a deeper level of information about the current and future coronavirus situation to help inform the response.</li><li>Google:\\u00a0The NHS is exploring the use of tools in the G Suite family to allow the NHS to collect critical real-time information on hospital responses to Covid-19. Data collected would be aggregated operational data only such as hospital occupancy levels and A&amp;E capacity. It will not include any form of identifiable patient data.\\u00a0</li></ul><p>As we have seen countless times in the last few weeks, a national effort is required to limit the impact of Covid-19, whether that means asking car manufacturers to build ventilators, private hospitals to aid the NHS, or technology firms to provide software to power the response. We believe that the support provided by these partners will enable the Government to respond more effectively to the crisis.</p><p>We have chosen these organisations in particular because of their knowledge in data and the skills they have for working in complex environments and delivering at pace in this time of crisis.\\u00a0</p><h3>What happens after the outbreak is contained</h3><p>When the pandemic abates and the outbreak is contained, we will close the Covid-19 datastore. The Data Processing agreements put in place with the organisations listed above include the steps which need to be taken to cease processing and to either destroy orreturn data to NHS England and NHS Improvement once the public health emergency situation has ended.</p><p>Already this crisis has reinforced the value of quick, secure collaboration. After the emergency is over, we hope to be able to use what we have learned from our technology partners to getbetter within the Government at data collection, aggregation and analysis in a way that protects the privacy of our citizens. Having relevant data to hand will make our systems more resilient and better able to respond immediately to the next crisis - or even predict it before it happens. Furthermore, sophisticated data analysis will allow us to make changes to the NHS, ensuring that our hardworking health and care professionals and the people that depend on them are served by a much more efficient and responsive organisation.</p>\", \"id\": \"91614fd1-c04d-4dfc-8943-7fb69a7b8349\"}]",

Agreements on data must not be perpetual nor exclusive.</p><h3>Be open and transparent</h3><p>We seek to work in the open as far as possible and therefore require those who work with us to:</p><ul><li>Be open and transparent with the arrangements agreed.</li><li>Appoint a named lead point person that can fully represent the organisation and take decisions on behalf of it. In the case of smaller companies this is about designating sufficient time of the lead contact, for larger companies this means one person being responsible for coordination across a number of departments to ensure that communications are rapid, efficient and straightforward for the NHS.</li><li>Develop a 12 month forward look project plan for agreed projects that we will publish.</li><li>In the case of machine learning or AI technologies we expect algorithms to comply with Principle 7 of the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\">code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology</a>.</li><li>Rigorously evaluate the impact of technologies and publish this.</li><li>As part of the development and deployment of new technology, weexpect companies to actively demonstrate engagement with patients and the public.</li></ul><h3>Leverage best value for the NHS</h3><ul><li>Projectsneed to actively support\\u00a0open standards and interoperability\\u00a0in the NHS and social care. Allowing products to interoperate with each other, with electronic health records, national and other third-party systems is crucial to the value they deliver.</li><li>Meet relevant health technology standards: building on the work of the NHS Apps Library, NHSX is currently developing an NHS-recognised\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools/designing-and-building-products-and-services\\\">Digital Health Technology Standard</a>. This will combine elements ofthe existing\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-apps-library/guidance-for-health-app-developers-commissioners-and-assessors/how-we-assess-health-apps-and-digital-tools\\\">Digital Assessment Questions</a>\\u00a0with other data and interoperability standards. It\\u2019s anticipated that all health apps and digital technologies commissioned by or used within the NHS will need to meet this new standard and anyone working with us would be expected to ensure that any relevant products meet the standard.</li><li>Pricing: we expect best value pricing for the NHS and socialcare, including zero cost for pre-commercial products, and in the event of opportunities for large scale implementations, substantial discounting to occur.</li><li>Contracts with NHS or social care collaborators: a number of projects will have formal NHS or social care collaborators and it willbe appropriate for contracts to exist between the companies and these NHS Trusts or other type of organisation. In these cases, contracts should reflect all of the expectations set out on this page. We do not expect to hold contracts directly between NHSX and companies.</li><li>One of NHSX\\u2019s ambitions is to leverage better value from larger technology companies. In line with this we expect contracts to\\u00a0outline the value exchange\\u00a0in recognition of the clinical and other expertise they contribute to activities, particularly those in a pre-commercial phase.</li><li>Creation of jobs and opportunities within the UK: we aim for digital health innovation to result in a\\u00a0significant contribution to the UK economy\\u00a0and to its strategic focus on data driven technologies including the AI sector. Those who we work with will actively commit to look for opportunities to do this. This will clearly range given the differing size and reach of digital innovators, but examples would include: creation of new jobs and services within the UK; the headquartering of a head office or R&amp;D facility; or investment in software engineering and machine-learning skills at leading universities. When these opportunities are realised, to agree that we publish them in line with our expectations of transparency setout above.</li></ul>\", \"id\": \"0844a5f5-5ecd-4bbe-8227-a43398ad5331\"}]"

Agreements on data must not be perpetual nor exclusive.</p><h3>Be open and transparent</h3><p>We seek to work in the open as far aspossible and therefore require those who work with us to:</p><ul><li>Be open and transparent with the arrangements agreed.</li><li>Appoint a named lead point person that can fully represent the organisation and take decisions on behalf of it. In the case of smaller companies this is about designating sufficient time of the lead contact, for larger companies this means one person being responsible for coordination across a number of departments to ensure that communications are rapid, efficient and straightforward for the NHS.</li><li>Develop a 12 month forward look project plan for agreed projects that we will publish.</li><li>In the case of machine learning or AI technologies we expect algorithms to comply with Principle 7 of the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\\\\\">code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology</a>.</li><li>Rigorously evaluate the impact of technologies and publish this.</li><li>As part of the development and deployment of new technology, we expect companies to actively demonstrate engagement with patients and the public.</li></ul><h3>Leverage best value for the NHS</h3><ul><li>Projects need to actively support\\\\u00a0open standards and interoperability\\\\u00a0in the NHS and social care. Allowing products to interoperate with each other, with electronic health records, national and other third-party systems is crucial to the value they deliver.</li><li>Meet relevant health technology standards: building on the work of the NHS Apps Library, NHSX is currently developing an NHS-recognised\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools/designing-and-building-products-and-services\\\\\\\">Digital Health Technology Standard</a>. This will combine elements of the existing\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-apps-library/guidance-for-health-app-developers-commissioners-and-assessors/how-we-assess-health-apps-and-digital-tools\\\\\\\">Digital Assessment Questions</a>\\\\u00a0with other data and interoperability standards. It\\\\u2019s anticipatedthat all health apps and digital technologies commissioned by or used within the NHS will need to meet this new standard and anyone working with uswould be expected to ensure that any relevant products meet the standard.</li><li>Pricing: we expect best value pricing for the NHS and social care, including zero cost for pre-commercial products, and in the event of opportunities for large scale implementations, substantial discounting to occur.</li><li>Contracts with NHS or social care collaborators: a number of projects will have formal NHS or social care collaborators and it will be appropriate for contracts to exist between the companies and these NHS Trusts or other type of organisation. In these cases, contracts should reflectall of the expectations set out on this page. We do not expect to hold contracts directly between NHSX and companies.</li><li>One of NHSX\\\\u2019sambitions is to leverage better value from larger technology companies. In line with this we expect contracts to\\\\u00a0outline the value exchange\\\\u00a0in recognition of the clinical and other expertise they contribute to activities, particularly those in a pre-commercial phase.</li><li>Creation of jobs and opportunities within the UK: we aim for digital health innovation to result in a\\\\u00a0significant contribution to the UK economy\\\\u00a0and to its strategic focus on data driven technologies including the AI sector. Those who we work with will actively commit to look for opportunities to do this. This will clearly range given the differing size and reach of digital innovators, but examples would include: creation of new jobs and services within the UK; the headquartering of a head office or R&amp;D facility; or investment in software engineering and machine-learning skills at leading universities. When these opportunities are realised, to agree that we publish them in line with our expectations of transparency set out above.</li></ul><p><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools\\\\\\\">Find key information and tools</a></p>\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"0844a5f5-5ecd-4bbe-8227-a43398ad5331\\\"}]\"}",

Agreements on data must not be perpetual nor exclusive.</p><h3>Be open and transparent</h3><p>We seek to work in the open as far as possible and therefore require those who work with us to:</p><ul><li>Be open and transparent with the arrangements agreed.</li><li>Appoint a named lead point person that can fully represent the organisation and take decisions on behalf of it. In the case of smaller companies this is about designating sufficient time of the lead contact, for larger companies this means one person being responsible for coordination across a number of departments to ensure that communications are rapid, efficient and straightforward for the NHS.</li><li>Develop a 12 month forward look project plan for agreed projects that we will publish.</li><li>In the case of machine learning or AI technologies we expect algorithms to complywith Principle 7 of the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\\\\\">code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology</a>.</li><li>Rigorously evaluate the impact of technologies and publish this.</li><li>As part of the development and deployment of new technology, we expect companies to actively demonstrate engagement with patients and the public.</li></ul><h3>Leverage best value for the NHS</h3><ul><li>Projects need to actively support\\\\u00a0open standards and interoperability\\\\u00a0in the NHS and social care. Allowing products to interoperate with each other, with electronic health records, national and other third-party systems is crucial to the value they deliver.</li><li>Meet relevant health technology standards: building on the work of the NHS Apps Library, NHSX is currently developing an NHS-recognised\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools/designing-and-building-products-and-services\\\\\\\">Digital Health Technology Standard</a>. This will combine elements of the existing\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-apps-library/guidance-for-health-app-developers-commissioners-and-assessors/how-we-assess-health-apps-and-digital-tools\\\\\\\">Digital Assessment Questions</a>\\\\u00a0with other data and interoperability standards. It\\\\u2019s anticipated that all health apps and digital technologies commissioned by or used within the NHS will need to meet this new standard andanyone working with us would be expected to ensure that any relevant products meet the standard.</li><li>Pricing: we expect best value pricing for the NHS and social care, including zero cost for pre-commercial products, and in the event of opportunities for large scale implementations, substantial discounting to occur.</li><li>Contracts with NHS or social care collaborators: a number of projects will have formal NHS or social care collaborators and it will be appropriate for contracts to exist between the companies and these NHS Trusts or other type of organisation. In these cases, contracts should reflect all of the expectations set out on this page. We do not expect to hold contracts directly between NHSX and companies.</li><li>One of NHSX\\\\u2019s ambitions is to leverage better value from larger technology companies. In line with this we expect contracts to\\\\u00a0outline the value exchange\\\\u00a0in recognition of the clinical and other expertise they contribute to activities, particularly those in a pre-commercial phase.</li><li>Creation of jobs and opportunities within the UK: we aim for digital health innovation to result in a\\\\u00a0significant contribution to the UK economy\\\\u00a0and to its strategic focus on data driven technologies including the AI sector. Those who we work with will actively commit to look for opportunities to do this. This will clearly range given the differing size and reach of digital innovators, but examples would include: creation of new jobs and services within the UK; the headquartering of a head office or R&amp;D facility; or investment in software engineering and machine-learning skills at leading universities. When these opportunities are realised, to agree that we publish them in line with our expectations of transparency set out above.</li></ul><p><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools\\\\\\\">Find key information and tools</a></p>\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"0844a5f5-5ecd-4bbe-8227-a43398ad5331\\\"}]\"}",

It will harness the power of data science and AI to turbo-charge our ability to make evidence-based decisions in health and social care.</p><p>Understanding there are ethical and safety concerns associated with the use of AI in health and care, the Lab will align to the core founding principles of the NHS; addressing transparency, safety, privacy, explicability and bias. By building on the foundations already laid, such as our\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\\\\\">code of conduct</a>, these frameworks and best practices will ensure the project maintains the support of the public, andpositions the NHS as a world leader in the development of safe and effective AI.</p><p>Through the creation of this Lab, and building on our existing work, we will:</p><ul><li>provide evidence of what good practice looks like to industry and commissioners</li><li>reassure patients and clinicians that data-driven technology is safe, effective and maintains privacy</li><li>allow the government to work with suppliers to guide the development of new technology so products are suitable for the NHS in the future</li><li>build capability within the system with in-house expertise to prototypeand develop ideas</li><li>make sure the NHS gets a fair deal from the commercialisation of its data resources</li><li>promote the UK as the best place in the world to invest in healthtech.</li></ul><p>We will work closely with the following partners to deliver the objectives of the NHS AI Lab including but not limited to:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/accel-access/\\\\\\\">Accelerated Access Collaborative</a></li><li><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-sector-deal/life-sciences-sector-deal-2-2018\\\\\\\">Office of Life Sciences</a></li><li><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/infrastructure/\\\\\\\">Health Data Research UK</a></li><li><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care\\\\\\\">Department of Health and Social Care</a></li><li><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/\\\\\\\">The Alan Turing Institute</a></li></ul><h2>Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award</h2><p>The Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award is run by the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) in partnership with NHSX and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). It will make \\\\u00a3140m available over three years to accelerate the testing and evaluation of the most promisingAI technologies which meet the strategic aims set out in the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/\\\\\\\">NHS Long Term Plan</a>.</p><p>The Award will support technologies across the spectrum of development: from initial feasibility to evaluation within the NHS.

We believe that this will bring the best solutions and most choice for patients and staff \\\\u2013 as long as systems are built to the same open standards and are interoperable with each other.</p><p>We expect digital innovators who seek to work with the NHS to:</p><ol><li>Abide by\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-of-health-data/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-for-patients-and-the-nhs-where-data-underpins-innovation#guiding-principles\\\\\\\">our guiding principles</a></li><li>Be openand transparent</li><li>Leverage best value for the NHS</li></ol><h3>Abide by our guiding principles</h3><p>Better use of data between the NHS and partners has the potential to improve diagnosis, treatment, experience of care, efficiency of the system and overall outcomes for the people at the heart of the NHS, public health and the wider healthcare system.</p><p>It must be done in a way which is safe, ethical, evidenced and transparent. People need to know that data about them is being used to develop and test healthcare solutions, and that their privacy and rights are safeguarded. For this reason, and to enable partnerships between the NHS and partners to thrive,\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-of-health-data/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-for-patients-and-the-nhs-where-data-underpins-innovation#guiding-principles\\\\\\\">the government has published five guiding principles</a>.</p><p>Digital innovators working with NHSX must abide by these\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-of-health-data/creating-the-right-framework-to-realise-the-benefits-for-patients-and-the-nhs-where-data-underpins-innovation#guiding-principles\\\\\\\">guiding principles</a>,\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\\\\\">the code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology</a>, the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-data-guardian\\\\\\\">Caldicott Principles</a>\\\\u00a0and the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework\\\\\\\">data ethics framework</a>.</p><p>In addition, digital innovators must be in line with all other relevant legislation including the Data Protection Act 2018, Common Law and the Human Rights Act and will need to complete the Data Security and Privacy toolkit. Agreements on data must not be perpetual nor exclusive.</p><h3>Be open and transparent</h3><p>We seek to work in the open as far as possible and therefore require those who work with us to:</p><ul><li>Be open and transparent with the arrangements agreed.</li><li>Appoint a named lead point person that can fully represent the organisation and take decisions on behalf of it. In the case of smaller companies this is about designating sufficient time of the lead contact, for larger companies this means one person being responsible for coordination across a number of departments to ensure that communications are rapid, efficient and straightforward for theNHS.</li><li>Develop a 12 month forward look project plan for agreed projects that we will publish.</li><li>In the case of machine learning or AI technologies we expect algorithms to comply with Principle 7 of the\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology/initial-code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-care-technology\\\\\\\">code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology</a>.</li><li>Rigorously evaluate the impact of technologies and publish this.</li><li>As part of the development and deployment of new technology, we expect companies to actively demonstrate engagement with patients and the public.</li></ul><h3>Leverage best value for the NHS</h3><ul><li>Projects need to actively support\\\\u00a0open standards and interoperability\\\\u00a0in the NHS and social care. Allowing products to interoperate with each other, with electronic health records, national and other third-party systems is crucial to the value they deliver.</li><li>Meet relevant health technology standards: building on the work of the NHS Apps Library, NHSX is currently developing an NHS-recognised\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-information-and-tools/designing-and-building-products-and-services\\\\\\\">Digital Health Technology Standard</a>. This will combine elements of the existing\\\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-apps-library/guidance-for-health-app-developers-commissioners-and-assessors/how-we-assess-health-apps-and-digital-tools\\\\\\\">Digital Assessment Questions</a>\\\\u00a0with other data and interoperability standards. It\\\\u2019s anticipated that all health apps and digital technologies commissioned by or used within the NHS will need to meet this new standard and anyone working with us would be expected to ensure that any relevant products meet the standard.</li><li>Pricing: we expect best value pricing for the NHS and social care, including zero cost for pre-commercial products, and in the event of opportunities for large scale implementations, substantial discounting to occur.</li><li>Contracts with NHS or social care collaborators: a number of projects will have formal NHS or social care collaborators and it will be appropriate for contracts to exist between the companies and these NHS Trusts or other type of organisation. In these cases, contracts should reflect all of the expectations set out on this page. We do not expect to hold contracts directly between NHSX and companies.</li><li>One of NHSX\\\\u2019s ambitions is to leverage better value from larger technology companies. In line with this we expect contracts to\\\\u00a0outline the value exchange\\\\u00a0in recognition of the clinical and other expertise they contribute to activities, particularly those in a pre-commercial phase.</li><li>Creation of jobs and opportunities within the UK: we aim for digital health innovationto result in a\\\\u00a0significant contribution to the UK economy\\\\u00a0and to its strategic focus on data driven technologies including the AI sector. Those who we work with will actively commit to look for opportunities to do this. This will clearly range given the differing size and reach of digital innovators, but examples would include: creation of new jobs and services within the UK; the headquartering of a head office or R&amp;D facility; or investment in software engineering and machine-learning skills at leading universities. When these opportunities are realised, to agree that we publish them in line with our expectations of transparency set out above.</li></ul>\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"0844a5f5-5ecd-4bbe-8227-a43398ad5331\\\"}]\"}",

This includes metrics suchas:</p><ul><li>Current occupancy levels at hospitals, broken down by general beds and specialist and/or critical care beds</li><li>Current capacityof A&amp;E departments and current waiting times</li><li>Statistics about the lengths of stay for Covid-19 patients</li></ul><p>These metrics will be able to be analysed from the national level down to individual NHS Trusts and hospitals. With an accurate view of these metrics in place, the data allows decision-makers to answer questions about the response and explore the impact of different decisions. This will lead to a better\\\\u00a0understanding of how the virus is spreading, when and where the healthcare system will face strain, and which interventions can best mitigate the crisis.\\\\u00a0</p><p>Using the dashboards, decision-makers will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand how the virus is spreading at a local level and identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations;</li><li>Proactively increase health and care resources in emerging hot spots;</li><li>Ensure critical equipment is supplied to the facilities with greatest need; and</li><li>Divert patients/service users\\\\u00a0to the facilities that are best able to care for them based on demand, resources, and staffing capacity.</li></ul><h3>How is confidentiality being protected?\\\\u00a0</h3><p>While moving at speed, essential data governance procedures and established principles of openness and transparency remain at the core of everything we do.We are following the same rules for information governance that underpin our day-to-day work.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The data brought into the back end datastore held by NHS England and NHS Improvement will largely be from existing data sources e.g. data already collected by NHS England and NHS Improvement, Public Health England and NHS Digital. All NHS data remains under NHS England and NHS Improvement control.</p><p>All the data held in the platform is subject to strict controls that meet the requirements of data protection legislation. GDPR principles will be followed, for example the datawill only be used for Covid-19 and not for any other purpose and only relevant information will be collected. Any request to access data will be reviewed through a single process controlled solely by NHS England and NHS Improvement and NHSX.</p><h3>Who is working on it</h3><p>In this time of crisis, we need the private sector to play its part to tackle these unprecedented challenges. We have therefore enlisted the help of some of the most cutting edge and experienced firms from across Britain\\\\u2019s technology sector.\\\\u00a0It is of paramount importance that the back end data store and front end platform are secure, and that all NHS data remains under NHS England and NHS Improvement\\\\u2019s control.\\\\u00a0Our technology partners are subject to the same strict rules for information governance that we follow in our day to day work.\\\\u00a0</p><ul><li>NHSX\\\\u00a0along with\\\\u00a0NHS England and Improvement\\\\u00a0are leading on this project working with multiple partners leveraging internal skills and also skills from the wider NHS family. The team is being led by the Director of AI, Indra Joshi, and Ming Tang, Director of Data/Analytics, NHS England/Improvement</li><li>Microsoft\\\\u00a0is supporting NHSX and NHS England\\\\u2019s technical teams, who have built a backend data store on Microsoft\\\\u2019s cloud platform, Azure, to bring multiple data sources into a single, secure location. A G-cloud data processing contract is in place.</li><li>Palantir Technologies UK\\\\u00a0is providing the software, Palantir Foundry, that powers the front end data platform. Palantir Foundry, which has been primarily developed in the UK, enables disparate data to be integrated, cleaned, and harmonised in order to develop the single source of truth that will support decision-making. Foundry is built to protect data by design. A G-cloud data processing contract is in place. Palantir is a data processor, not a data controller, and cannot pass on or use the data for any wider purpose without the permission of NHS England</li><li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\\\u00a0is helping to provide infrastructure and technologies that are enabling NHSX and its partners to quickly and securely launch the new Covid-19 response platform for critical public services at a time when it is important for public and private sector organisations to work together to combat this crisis.\\\\u00a0AWS has the highest score awarded by the NHS Data Security &amp; Protection (DSP) Toolkit.</li><li>Faculty\\\\u00a0is a London-based AI technology specialist that has an existing partnership with NHSX and is now supporting the development and execution of the data response strategy. This includes developing dashboards, models and simulations to provide key central government decision-makers with a deeper level of information about the current and future coronavirus situation to help inform the response.</li><li>Google:\\\\u00a0The NHS is exploringthe use of tools in the G Suite family to allow the NHS to collect critical real-time information on hospital responses to Covid-19. Data collectedwould be aggregated operational data only such as hospital occupancy levels and A&amp;E capacity. It will not include any form of identifiable patient data.\\\\u00a0</li></ul><p>As we have seen countless times in the last few weeks, a national effort is required to limit the impact of Covid-19,whether that means asking car manufacturers to build ventilators, private hospitals to aid the NHS, or technology firms to provide software to power the response. We believe that the support provided by these partners will enable the Government to respond more effectively to the crisis.</p><p>We have chosen these organisations in particular because of their knowledge in data and the skills they have for working in complex environments and delivering at pace in this time of crisis.\\\\u00a0</p><h3>What happens after the outbreak is contained</h3><p>When the pandemic abates and the outbreak is contained, we will close the Covid-19 datastore. The Data Processing agreements put in place with the organisations listed above include thesteps which need to be taken to cease processing and to either destroy or return data to NHS England and NHS Improvement once the public health emergency situation has ended.</p><p>Already this crisis has reinforced the value of quick, secure collaboration. After the emergency is over, we hope to be able to use what we have learned from our technology partners to get better within the Government at data collection, aggregation and analysisin a way that protects the privacy of our citizens. Having relevant data to hand will make our systems more resilient and better able to respond immediately to the next crisis - or even predict it before it happens. Furthermore, sophisticated data analysis will allow us to make changes to the NHS, ensuring that our hardworking health and care professionals and the people that depend on them are served by a much more efficient and responsive organisation.</p>\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"91614fd1-c04d-4dfc-8943-7fb69a7b8349\\\"}]\", \"blog_posts_blogtags_items\": [], \"authors\": [9, 10, 11]}",
